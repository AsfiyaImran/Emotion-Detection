EMOTION DETECTION USING MACHINE LEARNING FRAMEWORK




This proejct aims to detect emotions using diferrent Machine learning algorithms- Random Forest, K-nearest neighbors, SVM and ANN.



The feature selection is also done using Genetic Algorithm and PSO techniques.





The results are compared to find the best model using different evaluation metrics.
